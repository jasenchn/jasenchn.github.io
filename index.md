## About
Hi! My name is Jiasheng Si (司加胜). I am a PHD candidate at the [PALM lab]（http://palm.seu.edu.cn/） at Southeast University, supervised by Prof.[Deyu Zhou](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhoudeyu/Home.html).

I am interested in exploring structures from text, especially for Automatic Fact Verification and Argument Mining.

Hi! My name is Zhijiang Guo (郭志江). I am a Postdoc at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, working with Prof. [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io//). I am also a member of the [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/).

Before that, I was in ILCC at the University of Edinburgh, working with Prof. [Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/), Prof. [Giorgio Satta](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~satta/), Prof. [Frank Drewes](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/frank-drewes/) and Prof. [Johanna Björklund](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/johanna-bjorklund/) on AMR Parsing. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from SUTD, under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Lu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei).  I also learn a lot from Dr. [Zhiyang Teng](http://zeeeyang.github.io/). 

I am most interested in structures (tree, graph, etc.) from text. How to predict the structures and apply them to different NLP tasks. Currently, I am working on automated fact-checking.
