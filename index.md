## About
Hi! My name is Jiasheng Si (司加胜). I am a PHD candidate at the [PALM lab](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/) at Southeast University, supervised by Prof.[Deyu Zhou](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhoudeyu/Home.html).

I am interested in exploring structures from text, especially for the task: Automatic Fact Verification and Argument Mining.
